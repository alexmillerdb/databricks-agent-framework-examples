        "question": "What attributes make human rights considered universal and egalitarian?",
        "reasoning": "The concept of human rights as universal and egalitarian is rooted in the idea that all individuals, regardless of their background, culture, or nationality, possess inherent dignity and worth. This is reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The UDHR sets out a broad range of fundamental rights and freedoms that are considered inalienable and universal, including the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and the right to equality before the law.\n\nThe UDHR also emphasizes the importance of equality and non-discrimination, stating that all individuals are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of human rights as universal and egalitarian is also reflected in the idea that these rights are inherent to all individuals, regardless of their nationality or citizenship. This is reflected in the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, which holds that states have a responsibility to protect human rights even when their actions take place outside their territorial boundaries.",
        "answer": "Human rights are considered universal and egalitarian because they are inherent to all individuals, regardless of their background, culture, or nationality, and are protected by international law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [1]. The concept of human rights emphasizes the importance of equality and non-discrimination, and states have a responsibility to protect human rights even when their actions take place outside their territorial boundaries [2]."
